 PHP Form Validation - A Beginner's Example

I recently worked on a basic PHP form to help beginners understand form validation and data handling. Here's a quick overview:
    HTML Form Layout: The form collects user inputs such as first name, last name, email, password, website, comment, city, country, and zip code.
    PHP Logic for Validation:
    The PHP script retrieves form data using the POST method.
    It then uses a function to sanitize the input data, removing unnecessary characters and ensuring the data is secure.
    Displaying Submitted Data: After submission, the sanitized data is displayed below the form.

This project uses Bootstrap for the layout and some custom CSS for additional styling.

It's a simple yet effective way to learn the fundamentals of PHP form handling and validation. If you're just starting with PHP, this example can be a great reference!
