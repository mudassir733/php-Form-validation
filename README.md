 PHP Form Validation - A Beginner's Example

I recently worked on a basic PHP form to help beginners understand form validation and data handling. Here's a quick overview:
    HTML Form Layout: The form collects user inputs such as first name, last name, email, password, website, comment, city, country, and zip code.
    PHP Logic for Validation:
    The PHP script retrieves form data using the POST method.
    It then uses a function to sanitize the input data, removing unnecessary characters and ensuring the data is secure.
    Displaying Submitted Data: After submission, the sanitized data is displayed below the form.

This project uses Bootstrap for the layout and some custom CSS for additional styling.

It's a simple yet effective way to learn the fundamentals of PHP form handling and validation. If you're just starting with PHP, this example can be a great reference!





Step-by-Step Process
1. Prepare the Updated Plugin
Download the new version of the plugin ZIP file.
Extract the ZIP file on your computer.
Note the folder name of the plugin. This should match the folder name of the existing plugin in your wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Backup Your Site
Create a backup of your site (database and files) to prevent data loss in case anything goes wrong.
3. Write a PHP Script to Update the Plugin
Place this script in the root directory of your WordPress installation or a custom location.
